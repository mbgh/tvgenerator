 * A test vector file generator for hardware designs.
 *
 * \section secIntro Introduction
 *
 * During the development of a hardware design, one usually has to build a test
 * bench which in turn often requires a bunch of test vectors such as stimulis
 * or expected responses in order to verify the design under test. This class is
 * intended to simplify the generation of files containing such test vectors by
 * providing an easy interface to the user.
